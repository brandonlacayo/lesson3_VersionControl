            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Versioning Control talks about the main port that controls multiple versions of a file from multiple users. This also helps you recall certain versions that were used in the past without it being extremely complicated to find. Think of this whole system like a mini Google Doc. The main file is the doc (Version Controller) and the users send information (the files) that are all edited by multiple users. The only difference with this is that there is a way to see what part came from who unlike google docs where it erases after a correction was made. This concept will help students understand the concept of the systems for development. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control System or better known as "VCS" is the system that lets users know what was changed. For example, a VCS lets the users know who changed the files by revision history. It also lets users know when they were changed and what was and now different about the file. This is something that can be used if we are grouped up in class to use this. This topic interests me because it can be useful for many things, especially in group projects in an IT firm to create a new file for a project. I believe this will be something we use for the entire class.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Github is widely considered to be the worlds best and leading website for a software development platform. This is the place for version control and is what this class will mainly run on in my opinion. It works its wonders by allowing users to work and edit files to complete and finish it to its best platform. It also offers SCM which is short for Source Code Management and it also has access control with collaborations projects such as bug  bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.GitHub offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Main commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub has multiple commands that can be used to utilize the tool to its fullest potential. For example, the main basic commands are git init, git add --all, git commit -am 'initial commit', git log, and finally, git status. They are the main ones that the class should know by the end of the year. Remote commands are git remote, git pull, and git push. All these commands fall into play for the year and they interest me because it reminds me of the commands I learned in COP2258 but in a different format that will be useful for me in the future.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Internet Storage Unit</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A repository is something that you will find on GitHub no problem. Repositories are used as a storage unit but for information for users to work with. They also store multiple versions of your files and work with the Version Control System to make the most accurate and user friendly experience for its consumers. It usually comes with a READ ME file to explain what and where the project is coming from. It has the information of the users, the projects goals, and the date of creation. It can be used on local servers but its main goal is to keep it in one server to have multiple users work with it. I think this will become handy in class for group projects.</p>
